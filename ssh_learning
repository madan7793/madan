How to generate ssh key:

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   t for type
   b for bit
 
 it will generate two file 
 1. id_rsa   (private key)
 2. id_rsa.pub (public key)

rename id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys with below command
  mv id_rsa.pub  authorized_keys
 we will put public key in ~/.ssh folder 
private key will be shared with client to login on ssh server

to enable/disable password authentication in ssh:

  go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
please uncomment the below line
# PasswordAuthentication yes/no
we will remove # from below line and "no" for disable and "yes" for enable the password authentication
after that restart the service
